# Filing Wizard
 A Python program called the Filing Wizard is intended to assist you with automatically categorizing files in your "Downloads" folder into separate subfolders according to their type of file. This may minimize congestion and make it easier to locate things in your Downloads folder by maintaining it organized and tidy.

## Instructions On Utilization
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Download the "Filing Wizard" script from GitHub URL. Open the script in a Python editor 
or run it directly from the command line.

## Prerequisites Before Using
Python 3 or later

## Installation
You can copy the script code to a new Python file or download it directly from the GitHub source. Save the file as "filing_wizard.py" or any suitable name.

## Usage
Launch a command prompt or terminal.
Locate the "filing_wizard.py" script by navigating to its directory.
To execute the script, type filing_wizard.py in Python.

## Layout of Folders
The File Organiser script creates the following subfolders within your "Downloads" folder:

#### Images: 
This folder contains image files with extensions .jpg, .png, and .jpeg.

#### Videos: 
This folder contains video files with extensions .mov, .mkv, .mp4, and .avi.

#### Music: 
This folder contains music files with extensions .mp3 and .wav

#### Programs: 
This folder contains portable executable files with extension .exe

#### Documents:
This folder contains document files with extensions .pdf, .doc, .pptx, and .xlsx.

#### Others: 
Any other file types that don't fall into one of the previous categories are kept in this folder.

## NB
Only files that are not already in their intended destination folders will be moved by the script. The script will not move a file if it already exists in one of the directories with the same name.
To maintain the organization of your Downloads folder, it is advised that you execute the script on occasion or as needed.
